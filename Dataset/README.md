# Instructions

Here you should place many distinct folders referring to distinct Amazon product categories. 
For instance, you can create a folder called "Cell_Phones_and_Accessories", containing two files: *(i) meta_Cell_Phones_and_Accessories.json.gz * and *(ii) reviews_Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_5.json.gz*.
You can download the files from the official repository: http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/links.html
